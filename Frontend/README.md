This project is about booking a hotel;
for this project i created a very simple data base
to choose the destination (Berlin, Paris and Tehran)
which have limited info; but i will extend it as my final 
project because with my knowledge of SPA i couldnt do it more.

my main goal is to create a website in which every body can 
find a travel package to have a good moments with his/her dear ones.

i used useState hook and Routers and this part was very challengeable for me because the version of my node was 5 
but i needed 6 !! i tried to manage my components in a way 
to be readable for all. i made two data base one for select 
the destination and the other for suggested destinations.

i love my background and i think it encourages the users to
have a travel and have fun days.
